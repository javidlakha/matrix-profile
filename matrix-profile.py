#Matrix Profile Version 1.4.0

#A Python implementation of the matrix profile algorithm described in Chin-Chia Michael Yeh, Yan Zhu, Liudmila Ulanova, Nurjahan Begum, Yifei Ding, Hoang Anh Dau, Diego Furtado Silva, Abdullah Mueen, Eamonn Keogh (2016): 'Matrix Profile I: All Pairs Similarity Joins for Time Series: A Unifying View that Includes Motifs, Discords and Shapelets', available at http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html

#Currently, this implementation supports parallel processing and early termination. A planned update will support the updating of the matrix profile when either time series in the comparison is updated. A GPU implementation is also planned.

    #This function computes the dot products of a 'query' sequence of length M and every contiguous subsequence of
    #length M in the time series. It is used in the distance calculations in MASS (below). The heart of the matrix
    #profile algorithm is the insight that whilst the complexity of calculating the dot product of every 'instigating'
    #subsequence that starts at position 1, 2, ..., N in the time series with every other 'target' subsequence of equal
    #length is O(n^2), the dot product of two vectors is the inverse Fourier transform of the dot product of their
    #Fourier transforms. The time complexity of the Fast Fourier Transform is O(n log n).
    
    #NB. Computational complexity depends only on the length of the time series - not on the length of the 'query'
    #sequence. This is a useful property: short patterns do not take more time to identify than long patterns.
